<u>2017 Changes to the LFS PUMF</u>
<br><br>
Beginning in 2017, several variables in the LFS PUMF were added, expanded, reintroduced, removed, or collapsed. These changes have been retroactively applied as of the LFS 2023 revisions. Below is a summary of these changes:
<br><br>
The variable (CMA) has been expanded from 3 CMAs to 9 CMAs. 
The variables (NOC_10) and (NOC_40) were reintroduced. (Note: Beginning with the 2023 LFS revisions, (NOC_40) has been replaced with (NOC_43)).
A new variable (IMMIG) was added.
The variable (LFSSTAT) has been collapsed from six categories down to four categories.
The variables (NAICS_18) and (NAICS_43) have been replaced by the single variable (NAICS_21).
The variable (AGYOWNK) has been collapsed from six categories down to four categories.
The variable (SCHOOLN) has been collapsed from nine categories down to three categories.
Fourteen variables relating to family/spousal labour force characteristics have been removed: (EFAMSIZE), (EFAMEMPL), (EFAMUNEM), (SP_AGE), (SP_LFSST), (SPED7689), (SPED1990), (SP_SOC80), (SP_NOCS01), (SP_UHRSM), (SP_COWM), (SCH1624).
Eight variables have been removed for being out of date:
